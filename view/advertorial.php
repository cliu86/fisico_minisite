                        <p>Let's face the facts: joint pain stinks. It robs you of mobility and can make even the simplest tasks seem like a struggle.</p>
                        <p>And, if you're affected by this common problem... you may be making things worse without realizing.</p>
                        <p>Here's why...</p>
                        <p>When your hip hurts, or your knee is stiff, or your back is throbbing... what's the first thing you want to do?</p>
                        <p>Pop some Ibuprofen and REST.</p> 
                        <p>You want to stop moving so the pain can go away. Plus, you don't want to cause even more damage to the joint, right?</p>
                        <p>Of course not. But what you don't realize is that this the #1 mistake when it comes to their joint pain.</p>
                        <p>In fact, The New York Times recently reported that:</p>
                        <p><i>"One of the biggest mistakes people make with [joint pain] is to limit movement of the affected joint, which leads to stiffness and weakness that only makes matters worse<sup>1</sup>."</i></p>
                        <p>The bottom line?</p>
                        <p>If you want to beat joint pain, you MUST keep moving.</p>
                        <p>But when you're suffering from aches, pains, and stiffness - movement is the last thing on your mind.</p>
                        <p>So, what's the solution?</p>
                        <p>What you need is a safe way to soothe pain - without drugs (or even OTC meds) that are hard on your stomach, kidneys, and liver.</p>
                        <p>And while easier said than done, a new twist on an old discovery is making that possible (and without the dangers and side effects of commonly prescribed treatments).</p>
                        <p>It's thanks to a forgotten food which was once a staple of our diet. It has been recently proven to improve mobility by repairing damaged joint cartilage<sup>2,3,4</sup>.
