                    <p>Arthrozene's next-generation ingredients are clinically proven to soothe discomfort and eliminate stiffness while improving flexibility and mobility.</p>
                    <p>Without affecting your liver, upsetting your stomach, or putting you at risk for bleeding.</p>

                    <h2 class="pt-3 pb-1">Why does joint pain develop in the first place?</h2>
                    <p>It starts when you lose cartilage - that "shock absorber" that protects bones from grinding against each other. Loss of cartilage leads to pain as 
                        the bones rub against each other. This can make all movement, including walking, agonizing.
                    </p>
                    <p>In a healthy joint, cartilage is constantly being replaced, much like your skin or any other living tissue. Old cells make place for healthy new ones.
                         But when this process is disrupted, old cartilage tissue is "dying" faster than it gets formed. To make matters worse, 
                         the newly formed cartilage is often defective - it can not withstand the pressure of the joint.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="pt-3 pb-1">Why does cartilage break down so quickly?</h2>
                    <p>According to the Arthritis Foundation, there are several risk factors including obesity, injuries, and aging.</p>
                    <p>The joint loses its synovial fluid. This is the liquid that lubricates the tissues allowing the bones to glide smoothly. Loss of this fluid as well as changes in its
                         composition (becoming too watery) all lead to stiffness and pain over time.

                         The first line of defense is type II collagen. It is the main protein found in cartilage and what makes it such a good shock absorber.
                        Taking just 40 mg. per day of a patented form of this protein known to stop the breakdown of cartilage.
                        In fact, a recent clinical study, published in the Eurasian Journal of Medicine, split 39 people with knee pain. One was given generic Tylenol to relieve pain. The other took the same plus B-2Cool®.

                        Last but not least, the 3rd and final line of defense against joint pain is a herb known as Boswellia Serrata.
                        Boswellia is a tree native to Northern Africa and the Middle East. It has been used for thousands of years in traditional 
                        Ayurvedic medicine in India because it is a powerful anti-inflammatory.
                        Arthrozene contains AprèsFlex® - the next generation Boswellia extract... 10 times more powerful than other common extracts.
